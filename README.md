# PortforlioProject1
COVID-19 Deaths Data Analysis and Visualization Project
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 death data, with the goal of identifying potential correlations between patient age, pre-existing conditions, and the death count. By examining these factors, we aim to provide insights into the impact of age and medical conditions on COVID-19 mortality rates. The analysis is complemented by a Power BI visualization to facilitate an intuitive understanding of the data.

Objectives
Analyze the correlation between age groups and COVID-19 death counts.
Investigate the impact of pre-existing conditions on COVID-19 mortality.
Visualize the data using Power BI to provide a clear and interactive representation of the findings.
Data Description
The dataset includes information on COVID-19 deaths, with details such as:

Age of the deceased
Pre-existing conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, respiratory diseases)
Death count

Methodology

Data Cleaning and Preparation: The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and to ensure accuracy.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed EDA to identify patterns and trends in the data.
Correlation Analysis: Used statistical methods to analyze the relationship between age, pre-existing conditions, and death counts.
Visualization: Created interactive dashboards using Power BI to visualize the data and analysis results.

Key Findings

Age Correlation: Identified significant correlations between certain age groups and higher COVID-19 death counts.
Impact of Pre-existing Conditions: Found that certain pre-existing conditions are associated with a higher mortality rate among COVID-19 patients.
Interactive Visualizations: The Power BI dashboards provide a user-friendly interface to explore the data and findings in depth.
Power BI Visualizations

The Power BI dashboard includes:

Age distribution of COVID-19 deaths
Breakdown of deaths by pre-existing conditions
Combined analysis showing the interplay between age, conditions, and death counts
Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the factors affecting COVID-19 mortality rates, emphasizing the importance of age and pre-existing conditions. The combination of detailed data analysis and interactive visualizations offers a comprehensive understanding of the impact of these factors on COVID-19 deaths
